There is used case in which we keep adding RFQ into a container, the RFQs are kept for whole life time of process.
- Iterators of RFQs are passed around, and should not be invalidated.
- There is push back.
- There is no push front.
- There is no erase.


std::vector<RFQ>
- iterator will be invalidated whenever reallocation 

std::list<RFQ>
- overkills, as there is no erase
- no cache friendly

std::deque<RFQ>
- best choice, cache friendly
- does not rellocate, it is a map of contiguous buffer
- does not invalidate itertor, unless there is erasure
- deque's main objective is to avoid re-allocation in std::vector
