1. Out-of-order execution (OoO) — the big umbrella

The CPU may execute any instructions (loads, stores, ALU ops, branches, etc.)
in an order different from the program order, as long as architectural correctness is preserved.

This includes:
* register operations
* memory loads
* memory stores
* speculative execution
* branch prediction

This happens inside one core.




2. Memory reordering — a restricted subset

The visibility and ordering of memory operations (loads and stores)
as observed by other cores (or devices).

Memory reordering is:
* only about memory ops
* only observable in concurrent contexts








Out-of-order execution = order can be enforced with assembly instruction "CPUID"
Memory reordering      = order can be enforced with std::memory_xxxx
