1. Wrong suggestion from ChatGPT : 
   Cannot declare data member in class as auto, when they are initialized by "member initiailizer".
   Cannot declare data member in class as auto, when they are initialized by "initiailizer list".
   Why do we need this? Sometimes, we just dont know the type.

   class RefDataLoader
   {
       auto m_dirIter = std::filesystem::directory_iterator(".") | std::views::filter(my_predicate{}); // compile error
   };

   No, the above does not work. We need decltype.
