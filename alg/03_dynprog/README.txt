Subproblems in 1D array
* all problem in "02_dynprog_vec"   (see chap 02)
* L shape block                     (not implemented)
* Bell number                       (not implemented)


Subproblems in 2D matrix
* longest common subseq 
* connecting bridge                 (same implementation)
* edit distance
* parenthesis
* coin challenge
* shortest distance - 2 travellers  (not implemented)
* shortest distance - bitonic tour  (not implemented)
* piecewise linear fitting


Subproblems in graph
* Viterbi algorithm                 (not implemented)
* assembly line                     (not implemented)
* retrospective trader              (not implemented)
* coin change
* knapsack
* job schedule
* equal partition

* bin packing
- implementation 1 : moving between 2 map
- implementation 2 : use 1 map and region grow with a stack / queue
